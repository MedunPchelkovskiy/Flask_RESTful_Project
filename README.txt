The goal of the project is to create a portfolio site and a forum for it.
The idea is to share the creativity of both artists and technically oriented projects.
The site has a public section available to non-registered users,
where anyone can view the projects in descending order starting with those with the highest number of views,
as well as view the forum threads and comments on them.
After registering a profile, the user has the opportunity to create his own projects,
add a short description, photos and a category to each one,
he can also create new topics in the forum and comment on existing ones.
During the development, two external API services were used, one for storing photos on the cloud and
another for sending emails with a link to confirm the registration.
Future directions for the development of the site are the implementation of an internal chat,
through which users can easily make contact. Searching for different ways for image/files uplоаding,
so that there is no need to take mixed data from frontend and modify it, and methods for uploading multiple files at once.
Also adding verification to use the full functionality of the site only after confirming the registration via
the email sent, most likely by adding a decorator to the relevant resource classes.
