The goal of the project is to create a portfolio site and a forum for it.
The idea is to share the creativity of both artists and technically oriented projects.
The site has a public section available to non-registered users,
where anyone can view the projects in descending order starting with those with the highest number of views,
as well as view the forum threads and comments on them.
After registering a profile, the user has the opportunity to create his own projects, add a short description, photos and a category to each one,
he can also create new topics in the forum and comment on existing ones.
